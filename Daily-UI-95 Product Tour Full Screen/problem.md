Prompt: Product Tour

What product is being showcased? Is it a physical product like a shoe or piece of art? Or is it a digital product?

Whatever it is, it's up to you. Consider the most important features and use cases for the product.

Product tours are in-app tutorials that guide new users through an app or websiteâ€™s user interface (UI) and key features. Also known as product walkthroughs, they help companies simplify their user onboarding process while accelerating time-to-value for new users.
