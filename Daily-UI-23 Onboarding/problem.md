Prompt: Onboarding

Are you recruiting people for an organization? Are people signing up for a new service or website? Is it welcoming people into a mobile app?

Onboarding might seem trivial, but it's the first experience your users have with your product or service. It's like the first page of a book and it can instantly excite them. If not implemented well, a bad onboarding experience could turn someone off of a brand completely.

Website Onboarding is the process of guiding a first-time user through the product features and getting them to become loyal customers. ‚Äç Website onboarding, or any kind of onboarding process, is often thought of as a simple product tour. However, it starts way before the product tour.
An onboarding screen is an introductory screen a user sees when they open a new app for the first time. Onboarding screens typically consist of quick walkthroughs, tooltips, or other UI elements and end with the user taking key steps in the product
