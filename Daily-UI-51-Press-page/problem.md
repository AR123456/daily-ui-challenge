Prompt: Press Page

Create a Press Page design. Think about who you are representing and what important information you should convey. Is it for a new startup? A huge global brand? A nonprofit organization? Or a small local business? Or is it actually for a person such as a celebrity, athlete, politician, etc.?

Your press page is the public face of your brand. But unlike other news coverage, you control the narrative. It is the beating (well-curated) heart of your company.
What is a press page?
A press page on your website is dedicated to your organization's branding and press contacts. Sometimes a company overview accompanies this information as well as a mission statement, core values, and a brief list of executive leaders.

The purpose of a press page is to publicly provide the press with the information they need to communicate about your organization in a way that is factual and on-brand. When creating an effective page, the goal is to anticipate everything the media might need to effectively communicate your brand to the public.
