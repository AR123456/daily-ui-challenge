Responsive carousel: multiple items per page

This demo is very similar to the Carousel with single pages demo, except that instead of using flexbox for layout, it uses CSS multi-column layout and the ::column pseudo-element to create arbitrary columns that span the full width of the carousel and may contain multiple items.
