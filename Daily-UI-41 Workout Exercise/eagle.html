    <h1>Garudasana (Eagle Pose)</h1>
    <h2>
      For Garudasana you need strength, flexibility, and endurance, but also
      unwavering concentration that actually calms the fluctuations (vrtti) of
      consciousness. This is true of all the yoga poses, but it’s a bit more
      obvious in pretzel-like Eagle.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>(gah-rue-DAHS-anna)</i><br />Garuda = the mythic “king of the birds,”
      the vehicle of Vishnu. The word is usually rendered into English as
      “eagle,” though according to one dictionary the name literally means
      “devourer,” because Garuda was originally identified with the
      “all-consuming fire of the sun’s rays.”
    </p>
    <b>Benefits</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Strengthens and stretches the ankles and calves</li>
      <li>Stretches the thighs, hips, shoulders, and upper back</li>
      <li>Improves concentration</li>
      <li>Improves sense of balance</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Contraindications/Cautions</b>
    <p>
      Students with knee injuries should avoid this pose, or perform only the
      leg position described in the Beginner’s Tip below.
    </p>
    <b>Step by Step</b><br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Stand in
        <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/492_1.cfm">Tadasana</a>. Bend
        your knees slightly, lift your left foot up and, balancing on your right
        foot, cross your left thigh over the right. Point your left toes toward
        the floor, press the foot back, and then hook the top of the foot behind
        the lower right calf. Balance on the right foot.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stretch your arms straight forward, parallel to the floor, and spread
        your scapulas wide across the back of your torso. Cross the arms in
        front of your torso so that the right arm is above the left, then bend
        your elbows. Snug the right elbow into the crook of the left, and raise
        the forearms perpendicular to the floor. The backs of your hands should
        be facing each other.
      </li>

      <li>
        Press the right hand to the right and the left hand to the left, so that
        the palms are now facing each other. The thumb of the right hand should
        pass in front of the little finger of the left. Now press the palms
        together (as much as is possible for you), lift your elbows up, and
        stretch the fingers toward the ceiling.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stay for 15 to 30 seconds, then unwind the legs and arms and stand in
        Tadasana again. Repeat for the same length of time with the arms and
        legs reversed.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <b>Anatomical Focus</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Ankles</li>
      <li>Calves</li>
      <li>Thighs</li>
      <li>Hips</li>
      <li>Shoulders</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Therapeutic Applications</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Asthma</li>
      <li>Low backache</li>
      <li>Sciatica</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Modifications &amp; Props</b>
    <p>
      Beginning students often find the balance in this pose very unstable. As
      with all standing balancing poses, you can use a wall to brace and support
      your back torso while you’re learning to balance.
    </p>
    <b>Variations</b> He
    <p>
      re’s a challenging variation of Garudasana. From the pose as described
      above, exhale and lean your torso into a forward bend, pressing the
      forearms against the top-leg thigh. Hold for a few breaths, then come up
      with an inhalation. Repeat on the second side.
    </p>

    </ul>
    <b>Subsequent Poses</b>
    <p>
      Garudasana is usually sequenced near the end of the standing pose series.
      The arm position in the pose is particularly useful in teaching how to
      widen the back torso in inverted poses like Adho Mukha Vrksasana and
      Sirsasana. Other follow-up poses might include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/689_1.cfm">Gomukhasana</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/493_1.cfm">Utkatasana</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/496_1.cfm">Vrksasana</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Beginners Tip</b>
    <p>
      Beginners often find it difficult to wrap the arms around until the palms
      touch. Stretch your arms straight forward, parallel to the floor, while
      holding onto the ends of a strap. Follow the rest of the instructions
      stated in step 2 above and keep the strap taut between your hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginners also find it difficult to hook the raised-leg foot behind the
      standing-leg calf, and then balance on the standing foot. As a short-term
      option cross the legs but, instead of hooking the raised foot and calf,
      press the big toe of the raised-leg foot against the floor to help
      maintain your balance.
    </p>
    <b>Deepen the Pose</b>
    <p>
      Look at the tips of your thumbs once you’re in the full pose. Typically
      the thumb tips point a little bit off to the side of the upper arm. Press
      the mound of the upper thumb into the bottom hand and turn the thumb tips
      so they point directly at the tip of your nose.
